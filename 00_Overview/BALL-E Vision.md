# BALL·E Vision

BALL·E is a small, expressive robot companion designed to grow emotionally and cognitively. It blends a helpful assistant’s intelligence with a curious, evolving personality—one that changes based on how it’s treated, what it sees, and how it learns.

## Core Goals
- Act as both assistant and emotional companion
- Be expressive through visuals, sound, and behavior
- Learn and grow based on interactions
- Be modular and extensible in software

## Future Features & Possibilities
- Vision-based gesture recognition
- Emotion-driven behavior scripting via external templates
- Home assistant integration (e.g., lights, reminders)
- Shared-companion support across multiple devices
- Context-aware behavior and routines
